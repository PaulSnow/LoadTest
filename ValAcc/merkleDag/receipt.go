// Building a receipt is a bit more complex than just computing the Merkle DAG.  We look at the stream of
// hashes as we build the MD, and detect when the Hash for which we need a receipt shows up.  Then we
// track it through the intermediate hashes, tracking if it is combined from the right or from the left.
// Then when we have to calculate the Merkle DAG root, we do one more pass through the combining of the
// trailing hashes to finish off the receipt.
